# Visual-Question-Answering
A linear classifier build using neurel networks that performs text and image encoding using the clip model. The linear classifier model is build basd on a paper named Less Is More: Linear Layers on CLIP Features as Powerful VizWiz Model. The linear classifier performs visual question answering given a question and a image and it returns an approriate answer.
